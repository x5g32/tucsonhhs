I created this website for a local handyman business to learn React.js and Node.js.
As I continue to learn more about React and Node, I will update the website.

These are my current planned features and updates:
  1) Add side popout link menu for better navigation and link visibility
  2) Add a contact form that will send emails to the website owner
  3) Send emails using Nodemailer
  4) Better cross browser support
