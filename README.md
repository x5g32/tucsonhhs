I created this website for a local handyman business to learn React.js and Node.js.
As I continue to learn more about React and Node, I will update the website.

These are my current areas of focus for planned features and updates:
  1) Add a "Reviews" section to showcase actual customer reviews
  2) Add a contact form that will send emails to the website owner
